## 🌭 About The Flushing A

**Taste the Tradition.**

Serving the Flushing community since 1964, The Flushing A has been a family‑owned staple of Michigan drive‑in culture. We blend nostalgia with fresh flavor, delivering burgers, dogs, and fries that hit the spot every time.

## 🧠 Notes

- All images should live in `/assets/img/` — including the logo.
- Keep file names lowercase and use hyphens (e.g. `burger-combo.jpeg`).
- Use GitHub’s web interface or a local Git client to commit and push changes.
- The site is designed to be lightweight, mobile‑friendly, and totally GitHub Pages compatible.
