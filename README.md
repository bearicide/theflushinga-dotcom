## 🧠 Notes

- All images and graphics live inside the `/img/` folder.
- The **Menu** button on the homepage opens `menu.html` in a new tab.  
- The hours image (`flushinga-hours.png`) displays statically below the About section.
- Buttons use rounded orange-outlined styling for consistency across pages.
- Both pages share identical headers, footers, and fonts.
