## 🧠 Notes
- All styling is inline for simplicity — no external CSS files needed.  
- Each page shares a consistent header and footer.  
- The project uses forward slashes (`/`) for all web paths.  
- If you change folder names, update the links accordingly.  
- Compatible with GitHub Pages and local file viewing.
