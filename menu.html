      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>The Flushing A began as an A&W drive-in in the mid-1960s, founded by Larry & Chris Melancon. Larry had previously operated A&W locations in the Flint area before moving to Flushing in 1970, where he built a new dining location on Cherry Street and added a dining room in the early 1970s. The original Clio Road drive-in was part of their earlier operations.</p>

      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>Larry was widely respected for his strong work ethic, servant leadership, and commitment to mentoring staff. He also owned an A&W in Mt. Morris Township during the same era. He was deeply involved in civic service and the Rotary, and many locals remember him as a generous, hands-on business owner. Larry passed in 2016, but his legacy continues in the community and through his family.</p>

      <h3>Red Sauce Tradition</h3>
      <p>One of the Flushing A’s signature draws has always been its <strong>red sauce</strong>—a hot dog and burger topping beloved by locals. The red sauce tradition traces back to Flint-area A&Ws, where a homemade ketchup alternative became a family recipe passed down for generations and eventually bottled for sale. Locals still ask for it by name today.</p>
